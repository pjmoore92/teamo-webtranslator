    <h2>About me</h2>
    
	My name is Mrs Jacqueline Joëlle Cimatche and I trade under the name of Bethel Translations.<br>
	<br />
	As a qualified and experienced freelance translator and interpreter working from English and Italian into the French language, I understand how 	important it is for you to get your message across accurately and in an irreproachable style.<br>
	I also know that my client are expecting competitive rates, quick turnover, and a quality work. You have my guarantee that you will not be 		disappointed.<br>
	<br />
	I graduated from the Sorbonne Nouvelle University (Paris III) with a Master’s Degree in translation and later gained an on-the-job experience in 	 interpreting specifically in the public service with primary focus on medical area. I am an associate member of the Institute of Translation and 	 Interpreting (UK).<br>
	<br />
