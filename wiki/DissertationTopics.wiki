== FEEDBACK from Karen to be implemented before handin ==
Anything in emailed .pdfs (most grammar/spelling fixed) + the following:

*Before you submit make sure you check for broken refs. There is one on page 14. No problem for now, but it doesn’t look good in the final version
 
*P17 – perhaps use advertisement rather than presentation. Or even landing zone


#summary Things to talk about (maybe?) in the dissertation

  * *Security*: Encrypting the PayPal buttons
     * What was the problem?
     * How did the HTML look like unencrypted?
     * How did we fix it?

  * *Testing*: [http://seleniumhq.org/ Selenium] ?
  * *VC*: [http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-source-control/ SQL source control]

  * bash script to automatically upload changes from the SVN
     * Why? we had the code on the repo, but connecting to the DB remotely was not possible (or difficult).

*Joelles Taxes

== Tools ==
   * *balsamiq mockups*
     * Why? - easy to use; exports to XML, so it can be VC'd

== Implementation? ==
   * *Twitter Bootstrap* - CSS framework
      * pre-built UI components; UI design patterns;
      * quick UI prototype set-up;
      * pre-built JS components that we used to give a close feel of the UX

== Transistion from development to production ==

Couple potential pages here.. could talk about the processes involved in moving from a testing environment on Alasdairs server to Joelles own server and the changes we had to make etc. There is plenty of stuff from PSD textbook/lectures to provide ammo for this one.
