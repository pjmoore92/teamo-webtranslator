#summary A list and log of modifications of the wireframes.

= Wireframes =

== Notes ==
I chose [http://builds.balsamiq.com/b/mockups-web-demo/ balsamiq] for the wireframes, because of its possibility to save the wireframes in actual code. This way we could have it under version control. Since I'm not sure how useful this would be for us, any other types of sketches (photos, scans, etc) should do.

The `XML` code for each layout is in the repo, in the `wireframes` directory. To change a wireframe, copy the `XML` code, go to [http://builds.balsamiq.com/b/mockups-web-demo/ balsamiq], click on `Mockup > Clear mockup`, then `Import XML`. After you finish with your changes, first export the `XML` and update the repo, then `Download as PNG` and upload it somewhere on the interwebz, so you could paste the link in here. That's it.

The *main page layout* wireframe contains all the common elements of the pages. The other wireframes would show only the *main content box* for that page.

All the pages will have this basic layout.

The *header* and the *footer* sections remain unchanged on all of the pages.

The rest of the page's content goes in the *main content area*.

   * *Name* of the website and/or company logo
   * Main *navigation menu*

While the user is logged in, the *Login menu* would change its content, i.e.: _Login_ becomes _Logout_.
