In *Codeigniter*, `URL`s are mapped to a controller. For instance, when `example.com/page/main` is requested, CI goes to controller `Page`, and executes method `main`.

An idea of what our controllers would look like:

== Static page ==
(`controllers/static_page`)
   * About
   * Testimonials
   * Services
   * Privacy policy & the legals


== Client ==
(`dashboard/client.php`)
   * submit_job
   * pending
   * quotes
   * translations
   * history

== Admin ==
   * *TO BE CONTINUED*
