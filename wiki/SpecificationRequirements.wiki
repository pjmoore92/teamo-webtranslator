#summary The specification requirements document

_The document is intended for our client, so it should present her our solution. Also, it should be as non-technical as possible, since she is not a CS student (this was funnier in my head). We probably should have sent this a long time ago, but if we do, that should be ok for next week._

_It will also serve as a reference point for us further in the planning and the development process._

_Here be notes on the [Wireframes#Notes wireframes]._

_*Disclaimer*: the document is *not complete*. It needs more content to be added in all the sections and revised before it is finalized._

_There is also a [http://goo.gl/k3fGk Google Docs] version of this document._

== Introduction ==
This document is intended to describe the functionalities that the project “Website for a translator” should provide to its users.
It contains the *process* through which the users of the system will go when using the system, along with a *screen by screen* specification.

Algorithms or any other technical details are not discussed here.

The graphics of the pages are shown merely to illustrate the functionality. The actual design of the system will be developed over time.

== Product description ==
=== Scenarios ===

=== Process overview ===
==== Client ====
==== Administrator ====

=== Screen by screen specification ===
This section of the document will list all of the web-site’s different screens and pages along with sketches and thorough descriptions for each.

==== Conventions used ====
   * *green background* and *yellow labels* (fig. x) - used to highlight and label specific groups of content that will be referenced/explained in the document
   * *links* (fig. x)
   * *button* (fig. x)
   * *dropdown* (fig. x)

==== Page layout ====
https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-weQEZsURee4/TwwZ1xVYsSI/AAAAAAAAJj8/OnGnAwbvjDU/s1054/myImage.png

All the pages have this basic layout comprised of the following sections:
   * Header
   * Content area
   * Footer

The *header* and the *footer* sections will remain unchanged across all pages and the rest of the content goes in the *content area*. The rest of the sketches of the pages illustrated here will only show the *content area*.


*Header*

The header contains:
   * the *name* and/or *logo* of the website;
   * main navigation *menu*

The *menu* is a collection of links to the main areas of the website:
   * Home (Section X)
   * About (Section X)
   * Testimonials (Section X)
   * Contact (Section X)
   * Login (Section X) - this link must stand out, since it is of a higher importance and the page linked is of a different nature than the rest, so it is separated from the others. _(this was me trying to sound smart and stuff)_


*Footer*

Suggestions for content:
   * copyright notice, if needed
   * links to legal documents (e.g.: Privacy policy, terms of use, etc) - http://goo.gl/qZ8yU
   * awards or certifications (translation services related, PayPal certification)
   * contact information (actual information or just a link to the ‘Contact’ page)
   * link to the business’ facebook page

==== Home page ====
https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mE14xHW0TdM/TwwhA2nssOI/AAAAAAAAJkI/C2f6pySP5gI/s960/myImage%252520%2525282%252529.png

This is the front page of the website; it's what the users first see when they get there.

It is mainly composed of:
   # *tagline* - a few words describing the service and how it works
   # *quote* form - 

==== About ====
This is the page the users would go to in order to find out more about the service. Contains a few paragraphs that detail goals and accomplishments.
The page needs to answer some possible questions that the users might have regarding the business:
   * *who* is behind it?
   * *what* are they doing?
   * *when* did they start doing it?
   * *where* are they?
   * *how* are they accomplishing what they claim to do?

Providing an image, or even a short video, would make the website seem more trustworthy.

==== Testimonials ====
https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kgwTuXqNZFw/Tw9E3H7uaTI/AAAAAAAAJlU/M8svc4rbSY8/s960/testimonials.png
Having testimonials from happy clients also adds to the trust of the business. The business owner would ask her clients for feedback and permission to publish it on the website. Then she can pick which ones would suit her and post only a fragment on the website, along with some details of that client (name, company, occupation).

==== Contact ====
https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zWp-kPfmzB4/Tw9AaVTL5bI/AAAAAAAAJk8/ix50Gt1C0yI/s960/contact.png
Having other contact methods (phone number, physical mailing address) also add to the credibility of the business. “A company with no address is not one you want to give money to.” [[http://www.useit.com/alertbox/designmistakes.html Jakob Nielsen]]
