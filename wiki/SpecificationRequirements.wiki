#summary The specification requirements document

_The document is intended for our client, so it should present her our solution. Also, it should be as non-technical as possible, since she is not a CS student (this was funnier in my head). We probably should have sent this a long time ago, but if we do, that should be ok for next week._

_It will also serve as a reference point for us further in the planning and the development process._

_Here be notes on the [Wireframes#Notes wireframes]._

_*Disclaimer*: the document is *not complete*. It needs more content to be added in all the sections and revised before it is finalized._

_There is also a [http://goo.gl/k3fGk Google Docs] version of this document._

== Introduction ==
This document is intended to describe the functionalities that the project “Website for a translator” should provide to its users.
It contains the *process* through which the users of the system will go when using the system, along with a *screen by screen* specification.

Algorithms or any other technical details are not discussed here.

The graphics of the pages are shown merely to illustrate the functionality. The actual design of the system will be developed over time.

=== Screen by screen specification ===
This section of the document will list all of the web-site’s different screens and pages along with sketches and thorough descriptions for each.

==== Conventions used ====
   * *green background* and *yellow labels* (fig. x) - used to highlight and label specific groups of content that will be referenced/explained in the document
   * *links* (fig. x)
   * *button* (fig. x)
   * *dropdown* (fig. x)

==== Page layout ====
https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-weQEZsURee4/TwwZ1xVYsSI/AAAAAAAAJj8/OnGnAwbvjDU/s1054/myImage.png

All the pages have this basic layout comprised of the following sections:
   * Header
   * Content area
   * Footer

The *header* and the *footer* sections will remain unchanged across all pages and the rest of the content goes in the *content area*. The rest of the sketches of the pages illustrated here will only show the *content area*.


*Header*

The header contains:
   * the *name* and/or *logo* of the website;
   * main navigation *menu*

The *menu* is a collection of links to the main areas of the website:
   * Home (Section X)
   * About (Section X)
   * Testimonials (Section X)
   * Contact (Section X)
   * Login (Section X) - this link must stand out, since it is of a higher importance and the page linked is of a different nature than the rest, so it is separated from the others. _(this was me trying to sound smart and stuff)_


*Footer*

Suggestions for content:
   * copyright notice, if needed
   * links to legal documents (e.g.: Privacy policy, terms of use, etc) - http://goo.gl/qZ8yU
   * awards or certifications (translation services related, PayPal certification)
   * contact information (actual information or just a link to the ‘Contact’ page)
   * link to the business’ facebook page
