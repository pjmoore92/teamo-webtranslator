**Template**:

Controller\_name
  * method1()
  * method2()

# Contlollers #

In **Codeigniter**, `URL`s are mapped to a controller. For instance, when `example.com/page/main` is requested, CI goes to controller `Page`, and executes method `main`.

`*`more on [CI Controllers](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/static_pages.html);


An idea of what our controllers would look like:

## Static page ##
(`controllers/static_page`)
  * About
  * Testimonials
  * Services
  * Privacy policy & the legals


## Client ##
(`dashboard/client.php`)
  * submit\_job
  * pending
  * quotes
  * translations
  * history

## Admin ##
  * **TO BE CONTINUED**
